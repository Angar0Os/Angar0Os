> I am currently an apprentice at Movida Productions. As part of my studies, I need to complete a two-year apprenticeship. With this in mind, I joined Movida.  
My main responsibilities involve bug fixing and restoring functionality to systems that were created by the company before my arrival.  
Additionally, I need to learn programming languages such as Go and Python in order to take on several other tasks in the future.

>During my two-month internship at Ratel Studio, I gained various skills and completed tasks that brought me closer to the reality of Gameplay development.  
I learned how to work with a game-server structure and navigate through a large codebase.  
I was then tasked with setting up an interface to display the playerâ€™s skills and professions.  
Additionally, I implemented various gameplay systems and performed bug fixes.
